## Commit Time Tests

Thanks for helping us with this project! We're looking to get 2 durations from you:

- Duration of making a commit in the CLI
- Duration of making a commit in GitKraken

### What you need

- Clone this repo to your local machine (it's okay to use GK)
- Have a text editor handy (VS Code, Atom, Notepad++ etc)
- Locate the stopwatch feature on your phone or any other app

Please follow these prep step instructions, but make sure you have forked and cloned the repo.

### Pre-test: Make changes

1. Checkout the 'feature' branch
2. Edit lines 45 and 46 of the index.html
3. Fix typo in line 1 of mkdocs.yml so it says GitKraken Documentation
4. Answer prompt on music.md file
5. Edit line 3 of the reset.css file and change license from none to MIT
6. Change line 6 of ukdocs.yml from UNIX to index
7. Answer prompt on movie.md file



### Test 1: Make a commit in the CLI


1. Start your timer
2. In the CLI, use the cd command to change directory to where your repo is located. For example, I used `cd ~/Sites/Commit-Time-Test`
3. Stage changes from index.html, mkdocs.yml, and music.md using `git add` command
4. Commit changes using `git commit` command. 
          Commit message: "Personalized bio and fixed typo"
          Commit description: "Updated the name and bio in the index.html file, shared a favorite song, and changed GitCrack to GitKraken.
5. Stop timer and write down duration. 


PAUSE HERE!!

Do 1 of the following before moving on to Test 2
 - Delete local repo and re-clone
 - Hard reset feature branch in GK to remove commit from Test 1.



### Test 2: Make a commit in the GK


1. Start your timer
2. In GitKraken, open the repo and stage changes from reset.css, ukdocs.yml, and movie.md using Commit Panel
3. Commit changes with the following mesage and descrition.
          Commit message: "Updated license type and fixed typo"

2. In GitKraken, open the repo and stage changes from reset.css, ukdocs.yml, and movie.md using Commit Panel

>>>>>>> fe183c7... Revert "Second iteration"
          Commit description: "Updated the license type in the reset.css file, shared a favorite movie, and changed UNIX to index.
4. Stop timer and write down duration.


That's it! Please submit your durations AND operating system to Jonathan over Slack. Thanks so much for your help.
